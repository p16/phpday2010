OVERVIEW

fakemail is a fake mail server that captures emails as files for acceptance
testing. This avoids the excessive configuration of setting up a real mail
server and trying to extract mail queue content.

This is the Python implementation of fakemail. The original version is
written in Perl. Both versions are available from the fakemail project web
site. See http://fakemail.sourceforge.net/ for more details.

INSTALLATION

To install the Python version of fakemail run the following command:

    # python setup.py install

You will need superuser privileges if you choose to install it to the
default location. Alternatively, install it to a directory of your choice
using the prefix option:

    $ python setup.py install --prefix=/my/path
